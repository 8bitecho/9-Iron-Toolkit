A small set of ZX spectrum BASIC programs for creating quick menus.  The set contains two programs at launch.  Both are GNU GPL v3.0 Licensed.  All the tools are developed on a +3 ZX spectrum, with the +3DOS file system in mind.  Programs are written to use the BASIC file system commands (LOAD/SAVE/MERGE).  Making it possible to alter for other storage systems, such as a Microdrive.  9iB (9 item BASIC) was created after 9iM (9 item menu).  It is intended as a menu system but could be used to construct a larger program.  Both programs, are intended as crib sheets for enabling a quick re-usable code base.  The menus produced, are number key activated, 1 - 9 with 0 as an "Exit" call.  The exit call is intended to load another menu.

9 item MENU (9iM) - a menu system that uses LOAD calls to start other programs.

Use cases:
DISK menu system for the AUTO load using Spectrum Loader
Load other larger BASIC programs (which may reload 9iM on exit)
To load other nested menu programs (9iM or 9iB)
Quick menu for disks already containing BASIC loaders

9 item BASIC (9iB) - a menu system to call short programs in subroutines.

Use cases:
House short basic routines for repetitive tasks
More advanced loader for multiple machine code programs
Skeleton for a program
